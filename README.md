# Sampling_aggregated_populations
Data and code for a paper on the relative precision of sampling methods for aggregated populations

This repository contains all the code to run the sampling survey simulations of spatially aggregated populations used in a paper that is actually under review. Please contact me if something goes wrong with the code, or for any question.

## Steps you need to follow to run the code

1. Download the current folder.

2. Download the ZIP file "output.zip" from the Zenodo link below, and unzip it in the root directory. <br>
Zenodo link : [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6816238.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6816238) <br>
I have stored this file separately from the current directory because it contains the virtual populations generated in advance which are over 1 Gb. <br>

3. If you want to run all the scripts, you have to run them in the order of the numbers at the beginning of the file names. The scripts starting with 1 can be run in any order, but they must all have been executed before moving on to the scripts starting with 2, etc. But be careful, running all the scripts will require a lot of computing power and/or time. Alternatively, you can run any script independently of the others. All the files resulting from the execution of the scripts are already in the "output" folder, so the input files needed for any of the scripts are already available.
